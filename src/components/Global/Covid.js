                    <h1>COVID-19 Update</h1>
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic I am committed to protecting your continuity of care and providing care in the safest possible environment. To achieve these goals, I am recommending treatment be delivered via telephone appointments and video conferences.  I will try to be as flexible as possible in order to minimize any disruption of your care.
