      <h1>Treatment</h1>
      I believe treatment proceeds best during regularly scheduled appointments in the consistent 
      and private setting of my office. I provide individual therapy and medication management. 
      Because of my extensive psychotherapy training, I do not provide medication management for 
      patients in therapy with other providers. All work is done on an outpatient basis. 
      If inpatient treatment is needed, I am available to facilitate a transfer to another provider 
      in a hospital setting.

      I do participate in the VA Prescription Monitoring program."

      <h1>Termination</h1>      
      Ending therapy is an integral part of treatment. It should be considered carefully and discussed as oneâ€™s goals are achieved, in order to obtain maximum benefit from the termination process. In rare cases, it may be necessary to terminate for non-payment of fees.
