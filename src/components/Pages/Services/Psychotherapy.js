      thoughts, and behaviors in ways that lead to meaningful constructive change. 
      The most extensively studied psychotherapy is CBT. 
      This technique focuses on thoughts that cause distress, and ways to manage them,
      as well as the feelings and behaviors they influence. 
      Other therapies include psychodynamic therapy for relationship issues,
      help with bereavement for losses, cognitive re-programming for PTSD,
      motivational interviewing for substance use issues, 
      exposure and response prevention for OCD, and expressive therapy for other issues
      such as life transitions, aging issues, et cetera.ï¿¼"
